It was the year 1644 and the Mediterranean sea was a dangerous place. The naval forces of the Knights of St. John and the Ottoman empire clashed vigorously. In one of these many encounters, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, the Knights captured none other than the eldest son of the Sultan of the Ottoman empire, Prince Osman and the Sultan’s wife, Zefira.

The Grand Master Jean Paul de Lascaris treated the young prisoner with the respect demanded by his rank and entrusted him to the custody of the Dominican Friars such that they may give him a fitting education. At age 13, Osman was baptized a Christian and soon after he expressed the desire to become a Black Friar. He was ordained on the XXXX and thereafter was widely known as Fra Domenico Ottomano or Fra Domenico of St. Thomas.

While Fra Ottomano was receiving the finest education in the Catholic institutions throughout Europe, the most powerful men in the West, including the Pope were aware of this young man and his significance. At that time, the Catholic church had lost its presence in the East and was keen to re-establish a stronghold. Thus, the Greek Patriarch, the Pope and the Venetian Doge together with other Catholic leaders in the East planned to overthrow the ultan Mawmettu IV, Fra Ottomano’s brother and re-establish the Catholic empire in the East with none other than Fra Ottomano as Sultan.

In May 1669 the Western powers attacked Crete in order to execute their plan. The Ottomans however were well organized and defeated the Catholic forces and thus the plan to establish Fra Ottomano as Sultan, never saw the light of day. The world as we know it might have been very different! 

Eventually, Fra Domenico Ottomano returned to his beloved Valletta to serve the community he loved so much. It was a time of great hardships and the plague had recently ravished the local population. Fra Domenico was of a weak constituency since childhood and the grueling travels, the hard work he put himself through and other factors led to his passing away at only the age of 33. He was buried in this Basilica.

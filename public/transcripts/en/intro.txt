Welcome to the Valletta Black Friars Experience. 

You have just entered through the doors of the Priory, which, till today, is the home of Valletta’s Dominican Friars. A home which is much more than the beautiful architecture you are about to visit, the ancient books which hold our history or all the artefacts you are about to admire. A home is made of all the stories of struggle, sacrifice, love and much more which the Dominican Friars gave to the people of Valletta throughout the last 450 years. They gave it all, over and over again. In exchange, the people of Valletta formed an unbreakable bond with the Friars, a bond which is displayed magnificently in the Place you are about to visit.

Throughout your visit you will encounter 10 signs reading ‘Live the experience’. At these points we invite you to stand still and listen to our stories as they have been passed from generation to generation recounting the amazing feats the Dominican Friars overcame to get to where they are today. 

This is the essence of what the Valletta Black Friars Experience is.
